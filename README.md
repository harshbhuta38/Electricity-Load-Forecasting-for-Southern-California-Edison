# Electricity-Load-Forecasting-for-Southern-California-Edison-
This project was a part of my ISE-529 Predictive Analytics class from USC Viterbi College of Engineering
Problem Statement:- SCE is a power utilities participant that serves load for 15 million Californians in the California deregulated energy market (called the CAISO),meaning that everyday SCE buys and sells energy in the market in order to meet the demand of its customers. Having accurate load forecasts for SCE. Most of the forecasted load is bought 14 hours before the start of the "flow date" in the "day- ahead" energy market. The flow date is defined as the day the energy is consumed by our customers. The rest of the load is bought in the "real time" energy market in order to hit real time uxes of demand. The load forecast accuracy is crucial for SCE in order to keep costs down for SCE customers and to be able to balance supply and demand on the grid. SCE aims to predict the Load with a model yielding a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of under 4% for our 14-hour forecast in order to accurately purchase electricity in the "day-ahead" market.
